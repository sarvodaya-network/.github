# Sarvodaya Network

The Sarvodaya Network is an attempt to create an international open source network of ressources and communication platforms revolving around Sarvodaya, the vision of a non-violent social order as envisioned by Gandhi, Vinoba and other saints of the last century. In our network we try to preserve books about the history of Sarvodaya and its diverse constructive programmes and attempt to foster new ideas and approaches for the demands of our time. We try to facilitate non-violent organisation in the regional level, international exchange of ideas, mutual aid and so on. Our focus lies on serving the "last" first, but in the globalised society of today, our responsibility can no longer be limited to a specific country, because our style of living, our everyday decisions are affecting people on the other side of the earth too. We must not only focus on the help of those at the bottom of society, we must also focus on climate justice, we must promote self-reliance, self-purification, neighbourly help and the faciliation of a new way of life in accordance with nature and the well-being of all, always persisting on harmony between the means and ends, because we will reap what we saw.
